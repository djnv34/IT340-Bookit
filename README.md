BookIt is a website that allows users to easily schedule appointments with hairstylists, tattoo artists, nail technicians, and other personal care professionals. There will be two different roles, service provider and client, each will have their dedicated dashboard. Clients will view available time slots, book services in advance, and receive appointment reminders. Service providers will use the dashboard to manage their schedules, update service offerings, and avoid double bookings. The goal of BookIt is to save time, reduce scheduling conflicts, and create a smoother booking experience for both clients and service providers.
